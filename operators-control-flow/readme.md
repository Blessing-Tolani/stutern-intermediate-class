## Question 2

Examples

### Assignment Operator

let x = 5; <br />
let y = 3;

### Arithimetic Operator

x + y // Result = 8 <br />
x - y // Result = 2

### Comparison Operator

x > 80 // Result = false <br />
y < 100 // Result = true

### Logical Operator

x && false // Result = false <br />
y || true // Result = 3

### Bitwise Operator

x & 1 // Result = 1 <br />
x | 1 // Result = 5
